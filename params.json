These services are great, as long as we want to pay for your movie rentals. So, if we wanted to use the free alternative, we had to go on Torrent sites and get annoyed by all those suspicious ads. But now, there is AdmitOne.\r\n         \r\n## How it works ?\r\nAdmitOne shows you all top charts DVDs. When selecting a DVD for download, AdmitOne will search and find the best Torrent for you from some of the best Torrent site out there (Kickass Torrent, ISO Hunt and Torrent Reactor).\r\nThen, if you choose to download movie, your download will automatically start, and your movie will be ready to watch in a short time.\r\n  \r\n## Features\r\n - Top charts DVDs\r\n - Search\r\n - Rotten Tomatoes criticisms\r\n - Youtube Trailers\r\n - Language Selection\r\n - Quality Selection (HD/SD)\r\n - Download manager\r\n\r\n## Sceenshots\r\n\r\nCheck Top DVD Rentails...\r\n\r\n![Check Top DVD Rentails](http://admitoneapp.com/images/screenshots/mainView.png)\r\n\r\nDownload you movies in a click...\r\n\r\n![Download you movies in a click](http://admitoneapp.com/images/screenshots/downloadView.png)\r\n\r\nRead critics...\r\n\r\n![Read critics](http://admitoneapp.com/images/screenshots/detailView.png)\r\n\r\nWatch trailers...\r\n\r\n![Watch trailers](http://admitoneapp.com/images/screenshots/trailerView.png)\r\n\r\nSearch for any movie...\r\n\r\n![Search for any movie](http://admitoneapp.com/images/screenshots/searchView.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor feedback and support, please email info@admitoneapp.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
